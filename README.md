# QiSpace SDK Code Samples (Community Edition)
This repository contains source code samples(C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Swift and Objective-C) in the form of demos and apps for Quantropi SEQUR, QEEP, PQRND and MASQ APIs as well as the QiSpace RESTful APIs for retrieving subscriber keys, Quantum Keys (QKs) and Quantum Entropy (QE). The purpose of these demos is to provide developers with an idea of how to use the APIs correctly, rather than enforce strict implementation practices.

*The following items are contained within QiSpace_SDK_Demos:*
- Terminal-based C and C++ demo which requires installing additional `libcurl` and `Nlohmann` Json libraries;
- Android app demos in Java and Kotlin developed in Android Studio; and 
- iOS app demos in Swift and Objective C.

While the demos' source code can be viewed immediately, it may be necessary to contact Quantropi support, `support@quantropi.com`, for demo-specific classes and files containing QiSpace information to run and enable the full functionality of the app.

For more details, see README files in the respective demo folders. Additional API documentation can be accessed through Quantropi support or via the Quantropi website.
