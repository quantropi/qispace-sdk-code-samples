# QiSpace-SDK-Demo-C-App

A functionality demo based in C/C++ to demonstrate the usage of the SEQUR, QEEP, PQRND and MASQ APIs, as well as QiSpace RESTful API. For the best running experience, run the demo on an Ubuntu computer.

## **Overview:**
- **SEQUR**: Demonstrates the use of **SEQUR API to decode arbitrary QiSpace Enterprise payloads** using either a pre-loaded or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved subscriber key (subkey).
- **QEEP**: Demonstrates use of **QEEP API for encryption/decryption** and, if desired, the process of retrieving a Quantum Key (QK) from QiSpace Enterprise. 
- **PQRND**: Demonstrates use of **PQRND API for generating Pseudo Quantum Random Data** with either pre-loaded Quantum Entropy (QE) or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved QE.
- **MASQ**: Provides **Asymmetric Encryption** functionality. The two main functions of MASQ are **Key Exchange and Digital Signature** using a pair of public and private keys.

## **Installation and Preparation**
1. Download or checkout this git repository to the local machine.
2. Get the QiSpace SDK from Quantropi. QiSpace SDK contains SEQUR, QEEP and MASQ libraries.
3. Place the `libmasq`, `libqeep` folders containing MASQ, QEEP, SEQUR libraries for your OS under this repository's (`/c`) folder 
    - `libmasq`: should contain all the contents from `ds` and `kem` from QiSpace MASQ SDK .`ds` and `kem` contain the needed Big Number libraries.
    - `libqeep`: should contain contents from `lib` folder under QiSpace QEEP SDK and QiSpace SEQUR SDK

    The `libmasq` folder will look like below:
  
    ![libmasq, the libmasq folder](libmasq.png)

    The `libqeep` folder will look like below:
  
    ![libqeep, the libqeep folder](libqeep.png)


4. **[Optional]** Copy the `qispace_info.h` file which contains the QiSpace API URL and access token into `c/src` directory (This is only required for "Online Mode", MASQ demos do not require this file).
  - Note: If the above-mentioned `lib*` folders and `qispace_info.h` are not available to you, please contact Quantropi Support team.
5. Run `make install_depends` to install required libraries 
    - nlohmann json
    - libcurl


## **Getting Started**
### Offline Mode (Dry-run): 
  - Run `make [sequr, qeep, pqrnd, masq_kem, masq_ds]` (i.e `make qeep`)

### Online Mode: (QiSpace interaction is needed in this mode)
  - Run `make [sequr, qeep, pqrnd] QISPACE_API_ON=1` (i.e `make pqrnd QISPACE_API_ON=1`)

If an error occurs, consider running the makefile commands individually.

Note: After a demo finishes, consider running `make clean` for consistent demo execution.

## **Core Functionalities**
### SEQUR  `demo_sequr`: 
- Setup, configure, and cleanup  SEQUR API
- Make HTTP request to establish subkey using QiSpace REST API
- Demonstrate subkey unpacking
- Decode  existing QiSpace payload

### QEEP `demo_qeep`:
- Setup, configure and cleanup  QEEP API
- Make HTTP request to QiSpace REST API for Quantum Key retrieval  
- Demonstrate QK unpacking
- Encrypt & decrypt with QEEP API

### PQRND Demo `demo_pqrnd`:
- Setup, configure and cleanup the PQRND API
- Obtain Quantum Entropy from QiSpace REST API 
- Generate PQRND with the available data

### MASQ KEM Demo `demo_masq_kem`:
- Initialize MASQ using one of:

  1) QiSpace NGen random callback functions from QiSpace QEEP SDK, or
  2) User-provided random callback functions

- Generate Keypair using the MASQ KEM API
- Encrypt & Decrypt the message using MASQ KEM APIs

Test the below supported Key-Exchange algorithms:

`ALG = hppk kyber2 kyber3 kyber4 kyber2aes kyber3aes kyber4aes`

The supported Big Number libraries are `BN = qtp gmp`

> Note: Kyber library does not depend on any Big Number library. 

The Defaults used for the demo are `ALG=hppk` for NIST Security level 3, using `BN=qtp` and QiSpace NGen as the Initialization API to generate random numbers.

```
make masq_kem
```

To test other specific algorithms, run
```
make masq_kem ALG=<ALG> BN=<BN>
```

### MASQ DS Demo `demo_masq_ds`:
- Initialize MASQ using one of:

  1) QiSpace NGen random callback functions from QiSpace QEEP SDK, or 
  2) User-provided random callback functions

- Generate Keypair to sign the message
- Sign the message
- Verify the message and signature using MASQ DS API

Test the below supported Digital Signature algorithms:

`ALG = ghppk hppk dilithium2 dilithium3 dilithium5 dilithium2aes dilithium3aes dilithium5aes`

The supported Big Number libraries are `BN = qtp gmp`

> Note: Dilithium library does not depend on any Big Number library.

The Defaults used for the demo are `ALG=ghppk` for NIST Security level 5, using `BN=qtp` and QiSpace NGen as the Initialization API to generate random numbers.

```
make masq_ds
```

To test other specific algorithms, run
```
make masq_ds ALG=<ALG> BN=<BN>
```
